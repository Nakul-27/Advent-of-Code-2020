# Advent of Code 2020 - Scala
[![Scala CI](https://github.com/sim642/adventofcode/workflows/Scala%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/sim642/adventofcode/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Scala+CI%22)

This is my attempt at some of the Advent of Code 2020 Problems in Scala.

Since I am doing these problems after the fact, I did these out of order. As a result, there are some techniques that I use in earlier days that I don't use in later days. 

While I originally am doing/did these problems was for extra credit in my Data Structures course, I will be continuing to do them occasionally and will update this repo as such.
