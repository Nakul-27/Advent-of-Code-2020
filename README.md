# Advent of Code 2020 - Scala
[![Scala CI](https://github.com/sim642/adventofcode/workflows/Scala%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/sim642/adventofcode/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Scala+CI%22)

This is my attempt at some of the Advent of Code 2020 Problems in Scala.

Since I am doing these problems after the fact, I did these out of order. As a result, there are some techniques that I use in earlier days that I don't use in later days. 

While I originally am doing/did these problems was for extra credit in my Data Structures course, I will be continuing to do them occasionally and will update this repo as such. 

To view the Source Code, go to src/main/scala.

There are some problems that I completed in their entirety and there are some problems that I completed only partially. The breakdown for that is as follows:

Total Points: 20
Parts 1 and 2:
Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Part 1:
Days 3, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 21, 22
